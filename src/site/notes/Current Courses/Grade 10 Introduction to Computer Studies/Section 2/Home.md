2. Filling Shapes
	- The [latest version of the Turtle Sketches playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/030Bsp7EIEhY1TnLkzuz9v76w#Turtle_Sketches_Template_v4-1), version 4.1, allows for shapes to be filled.
	- To "turn off" fills, [[Media/Using a Clear Fill Colour|set the fill color to "clear"]].

3. Continue the [[Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints|T-shirt Shadow Prints]] task.
	- Ideally, at the start of today's class, your [[Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints#Exemplar|plan]] is complete and you have shared that progress [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/)
		- If not, finish and share your plan as your first priority.
	- Once your plan is complete, begin coding your design.

> • Do not use color.
	
#### To-do items
- [ ] Make significant progress on your [[Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints|T-shirt Shadow Prints]] task.
