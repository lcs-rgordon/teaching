2. Tying Shoelaces Exercise
	* Takeaways:
		* Computers take instructions literally. Very literally.
		* There are two kinds of errors, *syntax* and *logical*.
			* A syntax error is when the computer does not understand an instruction.
			* A logical error is when the computer understands and carries out an instruction, but the result is not what the programmer intended.
3. Joining our class on Spaces.
