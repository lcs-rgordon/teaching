### Thread 1, Day 12 - Wednesday, October 5, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Continue the [[Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints|T-shirt Shadow Prints]] task.
	- Ideally, at the start of today's class, your [[Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints#Exemplar|plan]] is complete and you have shared that progress [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/)
		- If not, finish and share your plan as your first priority.
	- Once your plan is complete, begin coding your design.
	
> [!TIP]
> • Remember, you need high contrast in your design – black, white, and maybe one shade of grey.
> • Do not use color.

> [!NOTE]
> • If you need to use fills with your design, use version 3 of the playground file (purple banner).
>     • However, note that version 3 of the playground has a bug where curves do not work correctly.
> • If you need to change line widths or use curves (but not use fills), use version 4 of the playground file (orange banner).
> • Mr. Gordon is currently working on version 5 of the playground file, where everything will work the way it should! 

	
#### To-do items
- [ ] Make significant progress on your [[Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints|T-shirt Shadow Prints]] task.

> [!NOTE]
> • Our next class occurs six days from now, on Tuesday, October 11.
> • The final version of your design, with all your code completed, is due at the end of that class.
> • Recall that Mr. Gordon needs time to [print your design to get it ready for transferring to your T-shirt](http://www.inkodye.com/guides/photo) on Thursday, October 13.
