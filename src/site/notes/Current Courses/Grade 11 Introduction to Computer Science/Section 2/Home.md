# Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science - Section 2
## Most Recent Class
### Thread 1, Day 2 - Wednesday, October 20, 2022
#### Agenda
1. LCAT
	- Please complete your [daily LCAT check](https://lcat.lcs.on.ca) prior to coming to class.
2. Hardcover graph paper notebooks
	- Gentle reminder: please bring your graph paper notebook to every future class for this course.
3. How to Duplicate and Rename Playgrounds
	- If you want to try out a new idea, or build on some existing code, make a *duplicate* of the Turtle Sketches playground.
		- If you wish to build from existing code – you want your existing code to be in the new playground – choose `Duplicate and Keep Changes`
		- If you just want a new Sketches playground to experiment in – you don't need existing code – choose `Duplicate and Reset`
4. [Programming with Purpose](https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-7DQJbMapI)
	- Yesterday, we looked about how Jordi Bruin solved a small problem – visually translating a menu – with the [Cibo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cibo-visual-menu-translator/id1583992402) app.
	- Sometimes, we can help others with major efforts, like writing an app, but...
		- ... how do we get to that place?
		- ... is that the only way to help others?
	- Please have your black hardcover notebook out while you watch *Programming with Purpose* with the class.
		- As you watch, write down any quotes that speak to you.
		- When you are finished watching, summarize a bit – what is *one* takeaway that you have from this video?
		  
*More to come...*
