### Thread 1, Day 8 - Wednesday, November 2, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Streamlined Process for Generating a Single PDF of your Program Code
	- See [this very brief video for a demonstration of how to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=0s) in just a couple of minutes.
2. Scoring AP Create Task Written Responses
	- If you have not done this yet, [score your partner's responses](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0fbCsLsJ4x9e7HcCt46Gt13Lg#AP_Create_Task_-_Scoring_Guidelines_) for the Colour Selector app.
	- When your partner has finished doing the same for yours, compare notes.
3. Colour Selector – AP Create Task – Written Responses Exemplar
	- The hope is that the exercise of authoring your own responses, and then scoring someone else's responses, helped you understand the [Create Task requirements](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0sTIjatjDQDaHmoI_k-dNcnUQ#AP_Create_Task_-_Submission_Requirements).
	- Here is an [additional set of responses](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/071RgpqekOwKSdJCmS8ZdrDsA#Written_Responses_-_Colour_Selector_-_with_full_program_code) authored by Mr. Gordon.
		- These responses have the requirements for each question, and the relevant portion of the scoring rubric, embedded in each page.
		- Hopefully, this will help you see exactly how these responses meet the criteria given by the College Board for this task.
4. AP Create Task: Working Period
	- The remainder of class time is dedicated to working on your [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Tasks/Create Task|AP Create Task]].

> [!NOTE]
> • The firm due date for the AP Create Task is next Wednesday, November 9.
