# Grade 12 Computer Science
## Most Recent Class
### Thread 1, Day 2 - Thursday, October 20, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Introduction to Search Algorithms
		- [Linear search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwsgCHYmbbA&t=6s) works on an unsorted list (also known as an *array*).
		- [Binary search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T98PIp4omUA&t=6s) requires a sorted array, but is much faster at finding the desired value.
2. Evaluating our In-House Sort Algorithms
	- Review the algorithms we developed in our prior class.

*More to come as our class unfolds today...*
