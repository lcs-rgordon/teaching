# Grade 12 Computer Science
## Most Recent Class
### Thread 1, Day 4 - Thursday, October 20, 2022
#### Agenda
1.  Consolidation: Improving Bubble Sort
	- What change was required to get the worst-case efficiency to be roughly $\frac{n^2}{2}$ comparisons?
			- Under what starting conditions for the input array would this occur?
2.  Consolidation: Testing Bubble Sort
	- Referring to the Study tasks from [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 2/Thread 1/Day 3#To-do items|our last class]] – would anyone like to share their progress with testing the real-world performance of the Bubble Sort algorithm?
