### Thread 1, Day 3 - Friday, October 21, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Joining our AP Class Section
	- [ ] Please sign in as a *student* to [MyAP](https://myap.collegeboard.org).
		- If necessary, [create an account](https://account.collegeboard.org/login/signUp?appId=366&DURL=https://myap.collegeboard.org/login) first.
	- [ ] Click the **Join a Course or Exam** button.
	- [ ] Submit the join code that is written on the whiteboard in our classroom.
	- [ ] Verify that the course information that comes up is correct.
	- [ ] If necessary, fill out the registration information (school you attend, et cetera).
2.  Consolidation: Improving Bubble Sort
	- What change is required to get the *best-case* efficiency to $n - 1$ comparisons?
		- Under what starting conditions for the input array would this occur?
3. Time Complexity
	- Introduction to the concept of [time complexity for algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZPTyGL2IQ&t=6s).
4. Measuring Real-World Bubble Sort Efficiency
	- We will now make a modification to measure the time a given sort takes.
	- Further modify your program to:
		a. Test a variety of possible conditions for the input array:
			- Already sorted
			- Almost sorted
			- Reversed
			- Random			
		b. Allow for consecutive trials to occur then report an average time for all trials that occurred.
		c. Allow for arrays of different sizes to be tested, e.g.: $n=10$, $n=100$, $n=1000$ *et cetera*

#### To-do items
*Prior to our next class...*
- [ ] Optionally... further improve the Bubble Sort algorithm.
			- What change is required to get the worst-case efficiency to be roughly $\frac{n^2}{2}$ comparisons?
			- Under what starting conditions for the input array would this occur?
- [ ] Complete item #4 above to measure the real-world efficiency of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
