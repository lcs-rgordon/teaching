### Thread 1, Day 6 - Friday, October 28, 2022
#### Agenda
1.  Building Apps with SwiftUI: Completing the Review
	- In yesterday's class we started to build the Colour Selector app.
		- [A video, part 1 of 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tdz4QSbvSYU)  in a series recaps nearly everything we looked at in class yesterday.
	- For the first part of today's class, you will finish building the Colour Selector app.
		- [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTGa2xtUVHk) in the video series takes you through everything up to, but not including, writing the list filtering feature.
		> [!TIP]
		> If you'd like to begin with the second video, and have the very same source code that the second video starts with, you can [download that source code here](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ColourSelectorFall2022Video/archive/08e13e84773912bdbcd42130189d01c678ac8fee.zip).
		- The [Part 3 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_BpXOvstO4) is much shorter and explains how to filter the list.
2. Connecting Colour Selector to the AP Create Task
	- As a group, we will:
		- look at how the app meets the requirements of the AP Create Task
		- begin [authoring written responses](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0sTIjatjDQDaHmoI_k-dNcnUQ#AP_Create_Task_-_Submission_Requirements) for Colour Selector for the Create Task			
#### To-do items
*Prior to our next class...*
- [ ] Finish authoring written responses for the Colour Selector app, as if it were *your* app for the AP Create Task.
> [!TIP]
> • This will prepare you for a discussion in our next class, where we will compare our written responses and [you will score your practice responses using the Create Task rubric](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0fbCsLsJ4x9e7HcCt46Gt13Lg#AP_Create_Task_-_Scoring_Guidelines_).
> • Remember, Mr. Gordon cannot provide you with direct feedback on your own writing for the AP Create Task, but he *can* discuss your responses to exemplars (like Colour Selector) with you.
